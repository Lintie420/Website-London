<h1>Thirst bar</h1>
<br />
	<p>Thirst is your friendly local late night independent cocktail bar. Situated on the corner of Greek Street and Bateman Street in the heart of Soho [since 2002]. Split over two floors. The ground floor is an intimate chilled space with plenty of seating and pavement access for after work drinks. We have a huge selection of cocktails included in our famous Stupid Hour and an awesome range Gins with individually paired garnishes served in huge goblets. The downstairs opens a little later and has DJ’s and a dance floor, order those shots and get your dancing shoes on, it’s going to be a late one. Click on bookings to reserve your space. We can’t wait to welcome you to our humble bar.</p>
